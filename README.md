# 404-Page

This challenge was to create a simple one pager that displays for the user the screen they're currently on is not available. 
We were instructed to replicate this design and put any personal finishing touches on it. 
It was also meant to be a responsive design where the screen view adjusts according to the device that the user is using. In this case,
desktop and mobile versions were incorporated using CSS Media Queries
